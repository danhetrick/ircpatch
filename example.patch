	=================
	| example.patch |
	=================

	This is an example patchfile for use with irc-patch.pl.  It will
	connect the channel "#ircpatch" an IRC server to running on localhost.
	IRC server on localhost, set the administration password to
	"changeme", set the MOTD to welcome incoming users, and turn
	verbose mode on.

	Multiple channels can be patched together (and the chat traffic
	from one won't be sent to any differently named channel).
	Multiple servers can also be patched together;  and channels
	patched on one network will automatically be patched to the 
	according channel on any named network.

	These elements are required for a valid patchfile:  channel, server,
	password, nick, alternate

	Optional elements and their default values: verbose (0), log (""), bot_chat ("*** "),
	ircname ("irc-patch bamboo-0.15.25 (IRC network-channel relay bot)"),
	motd (""), private_messaging (1), timestamp (1), information (1)
